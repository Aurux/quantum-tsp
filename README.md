# quantum-tsp

Made as part of my dissertation research.

This program allows you to benchmark and visualise the differences between 4 methods for solving the travelling salesman problem (TSP).

These methods are:
* Classical bruteforce
* Greedy convex hull (heuristic)
* Simulated quantum anneal
* Quantum anneal

The quantum computation relies on using D-Wave Systems Quantum Annealers.
